# Capstone project Ricardo Higginson: Global displacement insight: a comprehensive analysis.

OVERVIEW

This project focuses on analyzing data related to refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The analysis is divided into three main areas, each utilizing different tools and techniques.

1. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python
  
  1.1. Data Cleaning
In this phase, Python was used to clean two CSV files containing information about the number of refugees, asylum seekers, and IDPs. The cleaning process aimed to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and completeness.

  1.2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Following the data cleaning, an Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted using Python. This involved different techniques to assess the quality of the databases. The insights gained from this analysis helped in understanding the characteristics and patterns within the data.

2. SQL Queries for Database Insights
The second area of focus involved using SQL to query the databases. By leveraging SQL, important insights were extracted, providing a deeper understanding of the relationships and trends within the data. These insights served as a foundation for subsequent analysis and visualization.

3. Dashboard Creation with PowerBi
In the third and final area, PowerBi was employed to create an interactive and informative dashboard. The dashboard incorporates the cleaned and analyzed data. PowerBi's capabilities were harnessed to make the data accessible and comprehensible.

USAGE

1. Data Cleaning and EDA
To perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis, run the following Python scripts:
- Python_Cleaning task 1.ipynb
- Python_Cleaning Task 2.ipynb
- Python_EDA Task 1.ipynb

2. SQL Queries
Execute SQL queries using your preferred database management tool, referencing the provided SQL script:

- SQL_Queries_General.sql
- SQL_Queries_demographics.sql
- SQL_Queries_by_Region.sql
- SQL_Queries_Ukrainian_situation_2014_2022.sqlSQL_Queries_Ukrainian_situation_2014_2022.sql

3. PowerBi Dashboard
Open the PowerBi dashboard file PowerBI_Capstone.pbix to explore the visual representation of the analyzed data.
